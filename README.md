# Hi

A developer-friendly blog engine, written in Go, driven by GitHub.

## To Do

- [ ] Define post Markdown format
- [ ] Static page generation
- [ ] All controllers (what's the Go equivalent to a controller?)
  - [ ] All posts
  - [ ] Single post
  - [ ] Tagged post list
- [ ] GitHub hooks to notify
- [ ] Tests! (Probably to come later as I'm still learning Go)
