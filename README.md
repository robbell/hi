# Hi

A developer-friendly blog engine, written in Go, driven by GitHub.

## To Do

- [x] Serve static files
- [ ] Add GitHub hook to notify of changes
- [ ] Define post Markdown format
- [ ] Static page generation
  - [ ] Templates
  - [ ] Single pages
  - [ ] List pages (homepage, tags)
- [ ] Tests! (Probably to come later as I'm still learning Go)
