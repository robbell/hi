## Notes

To publish a new version of the app, build and push to Docker Hub using the below, incrementing the image tag:

```
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t robbell/hi:latest -t robbell/hi:1.1.x --push .
```

After publishing, update the image tag reference for the Container App to match.
